General description



known issues:
  - none for now

	
============================================================================
Fetching instructions:

From git shell write:

    git clone ----- your_folder

 

done !!! 

============================================================================
Building Instructions:

IMPORTANT: set your build folder OUT of the code folder,  
           the build must be independent from the code 

Use cmake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org


in my experience "eigen" is automatically found 

configure --->  generate and open visual studio
